#### If you are not familiar with Github, just open the translation page you want to change and search for the text you are seeking and edit it, alternatively you can open an issue.

## How it works
Our system use the KEY of the translation to find the correct translation. For example, if you want to translate the text "Hello World" you have to search for the key "HELLO_WORLD" and change the value of the key.

## How to contribute
You can contribute in many ways just by adding a Pull Request on the project: 
- Fix/improve existent translations
- Add new translations 
- Create new translations pages
- Improve this readme

## How to create a new translation page
To create a new translation page, please create a new file [lang]/index.json with all translations from index.json
